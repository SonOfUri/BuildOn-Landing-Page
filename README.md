![Lendbit Logo](website-design.png)

## Overview

Lendbit is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and borrowing platform that empowers users with full control over their financial assets, using smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) principles. The frontend of Lendbit is built with **Next.js** to provide a seamless and efficient user experience, integrating features such as **basename** routing and **smart wallet** functionality.

### Key Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Optimized for speed and SEO, delivering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Smart Wallet Integration**: Users can securely interact with the platform using smart wallets for gas-efficient transactions and enhanced security.
- **Basename Support**: Enables deployment flexibility, allowing the app to be hosted on subdomains or specific paths.
- **P2P Loan Interaction**: Borrowers can browse loan offers, and lenders can customize loan terms directly within the interface.
- **Collateral Management**: Easily manage token deposits, loan health, and automated liquidation.

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Make sure your wallet is connected and set to the correct network (e.g., Ethereum or Celo) when interacting with the app.

## Deployment

This README provides a clear guide for setting up and working with the **Next.js** frontend for Lendbit. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything else you'd like to add or modify!







This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
